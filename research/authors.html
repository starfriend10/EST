He serves as the center\u2019s \nassociate director for research and was the acting director in 2020-2021. He leads the Princeton WET \n(Water &amp; Energy Technologies) Lab with research focusing on energy and resource recovery during environmental \nprocesses such as wastewater treatment and reuse, water desalination, and remediation (https://ren.princeton.edu). \nHe currently leads several initiatives for water sector decarbonization and digitalization, including books and \nprograms on water data infrastructure and literature mining. He has received various recognitions with most recent \nbeing a recipient of the 2020 ASCE Walter L. Huber Civil Engineering Research Prize. Ren received his Ph.D. in \nenvironmental engineering from Penn State University.\n\nProf. Ren holds a joint appointment with University of Colorado Boulder and a visiting professor position at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Prof. Ren and the WET (Water &amp; Energy Technologies) lab members work on Water-Energy Nexus \nespecially in areas of energy and resource recovery during environmental processes such as wastewater\n treatment and reuse, water desalination, remediation, and carbon capture and utilization. They use\n electrochemistry, microbiology, and system engineering tools to understand the fundamental determinant\n factors of the systems so as to enhance design, operation, and monitoring in concert with traditional \n approaches. Prof. Ren collaborates with colleagues from different disciplines. The group has been funded\n by federal and state agencies as well as private sponsors and published papers in Nature Sustainability, \n Nature Climate Change, Nature Energy, Science Advances, Energy &amp; Environmental Science, Environmental \n Science &amp; Technology, Water Research, and other journals. Prof. Ren co-founded 2 companies with students \n to translate research findings into real-world applications.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Email: zjren@princeton.edu\n&lt;br&gt;Lab website: &lt;a href = \"https://ren.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://ren.princeton.edu/&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;School profile: &lt;a href = \"https://cee.princeton.edu/people/zhiyong-jason-ren\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://cee.princeton.edu/people/zhiyong-jason-ren&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n","width":1400},"id":"5462","type":"Div"},{"attributes":{"text":"\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size:18px\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Junjie Zhu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=\"figures/person1.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Associate Research Scholar\n&lt;br&gt;Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment\n&lt;br&gt;Princeton University\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Dr. Junjie Zhu (&lt;a href = \"https://twitter.com/Jun_Jie_Zhu\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;@Jun_Jie_Zhu&lt;/a&gt;) is currently an associate research scholar in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and \nthe Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at the Princeton University.
