# Overview of this website

This [website](https://starfriend10.github.io/EST/) (repository) is specifically designed to showcase research outcomes resulted from [Zhu et al. (2021)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c07551). Brief introduction of the study is described below. When the study was initialized, interactive plots (based on Python library, [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)) have been considered as a tool to better communicate the results. In this website, many of the figures were prepared using *Bokeh* to grant a certain of interactive functions, such as move, zoom, and hover over.
